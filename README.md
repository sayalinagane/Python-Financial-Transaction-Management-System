# 🏦 Python Financial Transaction Management System (ATM GUI)

A desktop-based ATM simulation system built using **Python and Tkinter**, designed to mimic core banking operations via a user-friendly graphical interface. This project enables users to create accounts, log in securely, and perform financial transactions such as credit, debit, balance inquiry, and viewing transaction history.

# 🚀 Features

**Create New Account**: User can register by providing a name, initial deposit, and PIN to receive a unique account number.
**Secure Login**: Account access using valid account number and PIN.
**Credit & Debit Operations**: Users can deposit and withdraw amounts, with instant balance updates.
**Balance Inquiry**: Displays the current account balance.
**Transaction History**: Maintains a log of all transactions (credit & debit).
**Data Storage**: Uses Python's file handling to store account and transaction data locally.

# 💻 Technologies Used

Python
Tkinter (for GUI)
File Handling (for data storage and retrieval)

# 📌 Purpose

This project replicates essential ATM functionalities and aims to demonstrate the practical integration of **Python programming, GUI design, and file-based data management** in real-world scenarios. It also helps reduce manual effort in managing financial records and simulates a banking experience.

# 🧠 Learning Outcomes
